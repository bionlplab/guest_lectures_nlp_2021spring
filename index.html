  <h2>Tentative Schedule</h2>
    <div class="schedule">
      <p><span class="announce_date">03/03/2021</span>. <b>Learning better representations from Electronic Health Records using Artificial Intelligence.</b> <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/wang-yanshan-ph-d/bio-20199713"> <em>Yanshan Wang</em></a>. <div style="margin-left:5em;">The widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has enabled the use of clinical data for clinical research and practice. Many institutions have established clinical data warehouses in conjunction with cohort discovery tools (e.g., i2b2) to support the use of clinical data for clinical research. Since a significant portion of relevant patient information is embedded in clinical narratives, natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as information extraction are critical when using EHR data for clinical research. However, the existing NLP methods are either optimized for a single information extraction task or have imperfect generalized performance. This problem is magnified when the extracted NLP artifacts are utilized in downstream applications, such as matching inclusion and exclusion criteria in cohort discovery. In this talk, I will present the Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods on EHRs using deep representation techniques to compensate for NLP approaches. I will discuss why learning better representations from EHRs is crucial for clinical applications of AI, and conclude with some potential future works.</div></p></div>

    <div class="schedule">
      <p><span class="announce_date">03/10/2021</span>. <b>Recommendation Systems to Improve Reusability of Biomedical Datasets</b>. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gT1xOhcAAAAJ&hl=en"> <em>Braja Gopal Patra</em></a>. <div style="margin-left:5em;">Recent scientific discoveries have generated an extensive amount of data and these datasets are being stored in different repositories. Most of these datasets are used only once. Several biomedical dataset repositories are available integrated with search engines, which can help researchers looking to find specific types of datasets. DataMed (https://datamed.org) or Google Dataset Search may be helpful to researchers in finding relevant datasets. Researchers who generally want to find datasets related to their interests, but do not have a particular interest in mind, could benefit from a dataset recommendation system. Further, it is diﬀicult for researchers to keep track and search for new datasets related to their research field in the complex search environment. A dataset recommendation system will help solve the above searching problem and reduce the effort for searching suitable datasets. Once a dataset is found, a researcher may need to find relevant literature in the dataset’s domain. I will describe different content-based recommendation systems that we developed for finding datasets suitable for researchers and literature in the domain of datasets. </div></p></div>

    <div class="schedule">
      <p><span class="announce_date">03/17/2021</span>. <b>Applying Machine Learning to Biomedical Literature Mining.</b> <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/kyubumlee/home"> <em>Kyubum Lee</em></a>. <div style="margin-left:5em;">Biomedical literature is a rich resource for obtaining key biomedical knowledge. Most of the new biomedical research findings are presented and published in peer-reviewed journals or conference publications, and indexed in literature databases such as PubMed or PubMed Central. However, considering that more than 3000 biomedical publications are indexed in PubMed every day, on average, finding relevant information is becoming increasingly difficult. In this talk, I will briefly introduce the available biomedical literature resources, and show a few case studies in which machine learning and more specifically text classification is used for extracting valuable information from biomedical literature.</div></p></div>

    <div class="schedule">
      <p><span class="announce_date">03/24/2021</span>. <b>The application of Natural Language Processing to social media for public health.</b> <a href="https://sbmi.uth.edu/faculty-and-staff/jingcheng-du.htm"> <em>Jingcheng Du</em></a>. <div style="margin-left:5em;">Social media provides the opportunity as well as the convenience for millions of users to generate, share, receive, and comment on social content at any time. The burgeoning popularity and its deep penetration to everyday life make social media a great resource to study health-related topics. As a significant portion of the data shared on social media is in the natural language format, Natural Language Processing (NLP) plays a major role in social media data mining. In this lecture, I will introduce several case studies at our research lab and beyond related to using NLP tools for social media data mining on public health topics.</div></p></div>

    <div class="schedule">
      <p><span class="announce_date">03/31/2021</span>. <b>TBD</b>. <a href="https://yeganova.com/"> <em>Lana Yeganova</em></a>. <div style="margin-left:5em;">PubMed is a freely accessible system for searching biomedical literature and is one of the most widely used resources at the National Library of Medicine, NIH. PubMed is visited daily by millions of users, including scientific researchers, healthcare professionals, and general population. Continuous enhancement of PubMed search functionality is vital to better meet our users’ needs. Many components contribute to a successful search, including semantic understanding of queries and user intent, smart document indexing approaches, as well as state of the art search and ranking algorithms. In this talk, I will provide an overview of methods we have recently developed and incorporated into PubMed to improve literature search and user experience. </div></p></div>
